Data Comiled by: Dean De Cock

Description: Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't
begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad 
in the United States. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of 
residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this data can be used to predict the final price and 
other characteristics of each home.

The Zipfolder contains the following data:

1. Ames Housing ML1 Project.Rproj: the whole project in an Rproj format

2. dataset: includes 2 files: AmesHousing.csv and data_description.txt

3. variables_description.docx: the brief explanation of each variable (easier to read)

4. Ames_Housing_Draft.Rmd, Ames_Housing_Draft.html: The full analysis with all codes are shown as the draft version (step-by-step approach). 
Each machine learning technique is one chapter.

5. All of files with .png: to include the images in our report

6. Ames_Housing_Final_Report.Rmd, Ames_Housing_Final_Report.html: the final Rmarkdown and the final report (official version)
